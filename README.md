# AI Astrologer App

A rule-based astrology app built with Streamlit, meeting requirements for clean UI, astrology output, and free-text question.

## Setup
1. Clone repo: `git clone [your-github-link]`
2. Create venv: `python -m venv venv` & `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `streamlit run app.py`

## Features
- Collects birth details (Name, DOB, Time, Place) via clean UI with date range 1900-2025.
- Generates rule-based astrology horoscope.
- Supports one free-text astrology question with keyword-based responses.

## Note
Switched to rule-based due to persistent AI API issues (403, 429, model errors).
